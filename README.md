# Web Crawling and Scraping Policy
## Advanced Analytica's policy for Web Crawling and Scraping Policy.

## Background
Use of alternative data sources is vital for Advanced Analytica to achieve its business objectives and delivery its DiffWatch® service for identifying and analysing changes in legislation and regulations. Web Scraping is one of these alternative data sources often used to supplement existing data sources. Therefore, the purpose of this policy is to ensure that Web Scraping activities are conducted transparently, ethically and responsibly with respect to all relevant legislation. This policy sets out the practices and procedures that Advanced Analytica will follow when carrying out Web Scraping. 

Web scraping is defined as the automatic collection of data from the internet, typically from HTML, PDF or CSV files, using a piece of software or program called a Web Scraper. Advanced Analytica's Web Scraping and data analsyis system is called - DiffWatch®.

## Scope
This policy sets out the practices and procedures that Advanced Analytica follows when carrying out Web Scraping and analysis activities with DiffWatch®. 

**Note that this document does not cover the use of Application Programming Interfaces (API’s) and applies only to Advanced Analytica and the DiffWatch® service.**

## Next Review
We aim to keep all guidance up to date and undertake regular reviews to ensure this guidance remains relevant. The next scheduled review date for this guidance is 01/06/2023.

## Compliance
Advanced Analytica will comply with this policy in any project involving data collection from the web in relation to DiffWatch®. 

## Policy Statement
Advanced Analytica is carrying out Web Scraping activity for the purposes of its business objectives in particular for the detection in changes to legislation and regulations and data collected from alternative data sources.

Advanced Analytica will adopt the following principles to guide DiffWatch® activities:

- Seek to minimise the burden on scraped sites
- Abide by all applicable legislation and monitor the evolving legal and ethical situation
- Protect all personal data


## Policy Details

### Seek to minimise the burden on scraped sites
Excessive use of Web Scraping can be burdensome, and overuse on a single webpage may have a detrimental impact to the operation of the website. To avoid such scenarios, we will maintain a register of DiffWatch® activity and follow these practices, where applicable, and always act within the law:

- Assess other possible data collection methods, such API’s or Webservices, before considering the use of Web Crawling and Web Scraping
- Respect scraping limitations enforced via documents like the Robots Exclusion Protocol (Robots.txt) and Site Terms and Conditions
- Delay accessing pages on the same domain
- Adding idle time between requests
- Limiting the depth of crawl for link collection within the given domain
- When scraping multiple domains, parallelising the crawling operation to minimise successive requests to the same domain
- Scraping at a time of day when the website is unlikely to be experiencing heavy traffic - for example, early in the morning or late in the night
- Optimising the scraping strategy to minimise volumes of requests to domains
- Only collect the parts of pages required for the initial purpose
- Include a User Agent String to differentiate DiffWatch® from other users with a link to this policy

Please note that this list of best practices is non-exhaustive and Advanced Analytica will strive to maintain a high-standard for DiffWatch® operations by monitoring and implementing best practices for AI data protection guidelines.

## Abide by applicable legislation and monitor the evolving legal and ethical situation

Advanced Analytica understands that the legal situation surrounding Web Crawling and Web Scraping is complex and ever evolving; and there are relatively few relevant legal precedents for conducting such activities. Advanced Analytica will continue to monitor the legal situation as it evolves and amend our approach accordingly. Likewise, Advanced Analytica recognises the use of DiffWatch® and the processing of data collected in this manner may give rise to a variety of ethical issues and challenges. To address these issues Advanced Analytica has implemented the [Guidance on AI and Data Protectionin](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-dp-themes/guidance-on-artificial-intelligence-and-data-protection/) and the [AI and Data Protection Risk Toolkit](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-dp-themes/guidance-on-ai-and-data-protection/ai-and-data-protection-risk-toolkit/) to mitigate potential ethical risks both directly and indirectly attributed to DiffWatch® operations.

Clients who wish to engage the DiffWatch® service must document and justify the rationale, the legal and ethical reasoning and the benefits of conducting the programme. This rationale will be used as the basis for approval by Advanced Analytica and will be scrutinised during the assessment phase to ensure continued alignment with applicable legislation. 

## Personal data protection and artificial intelligence (AI)
Advanced Analytica is fully commited to compliance with the [Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/contents)) (Opens in a new window) and ensuring that personal data is used lawfully, and fairly and transparently protected in particlar where artificial intelligence is used. Data protection is of great importance to Advanced Analytica, not only because it is critical to the practice of our business, but also because it ensures we protect individual privacy and maintain public confidence in our business.

# Accompanying guidance
## Web Crawling steps
### Web Crawling request

 - Advanced Analytica clients wishing to engage DiffWatch® services should contact Advanced Analytica as soon as possible after identifying the requirement
 - A DiffWatch® request document [LINK] must be completed and attached to the correspondence for review
 - Please note that the Advanced Analytica may conduct a feasibility crawl on an authorised target website. During this crawl no data will be stored by Advanced Analytica. Advanced Analytica will ensure that this process remains in line with policy.

### DiffWatch® Evaluation
 - Clients will provide Advanced Analytica with a new request and completed request document
 - Advanced Analytica will evaluate the request document and verify whether DiffWatch® can be lawfully engaged 
 - Advanced Analytica will perform relevant AI risk assessments in line with the [ICO Guidance on AI and data protection](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-dp-themes/guidance-on-artificial-intelligence-and-data-protection/)

### Web Crawling Log
Advanced Analytica will update the central crawling log with the approved activities and inform the business unit they can begin scraping. This is to ensure that the correct level of due dilligence is assigned to each project and that all activities are recorded for auditability and accountability purposes in the Web Crawling Log.

### DiffWatch® Operations
Web Crawling using activities using DiffWatch® can commence and will only be undertaken in accordance with this Web Crawling Policy and corresponding best practices.

# Glossary
### Application Programming Interface (API)
In terms of web scraping, an API can be built by the owner of a website to allow easy access to data held on the site without the need for building a web scraper.

### Depth of Crawl
Depth of crawl refers to how far into a websites page hiearchy a web-crawler accesses. A websites homepage is the top of this hierarchy (level 0), pages linked from the home page are at level 1, pages linked from level 1 pages are level 2 and so forth. Limiting the depth of crawl therefore means limiting which level the web-crawler will access.

### DiffWatch®
A combined Web Crawling and Web scraping system that automate collection of data from the internet typically from HTML or PDF or CSV files, using proprietary software and methodologies developed by Advanced Analytica. The DiffWatch® system has been developed with data protection by design and by default with a lawyer-in-the-loop®.

### Hypertext Markup Language
The standard markup language for defining the structure of web pages. HTML elements are used to tell the browser how to display the contents of a web page.

### Idle Time
Idle time, or sleep time, is the pause between each request made to a website by the scraper.

### Lawyer-in-the-loop®
A combined Web Crawling and Web scraping system that automate collection of data from the internet typically from HTML or PDF or CSV files, using proprietary software and methodologies developed by Advanced Analytica. DiffWatch® is the only web data collection service that builds lawyer-in-the-loop® processing pipelines with data protection by design and by default. 

### Parallelising the Crawling
A parallel crawler is a crawler that runs multiple processes in parallel with the goal to maximise download rates and minimise scraping overheads. For example, if website A and B contain multiple webages, then a parallelised crawl might capture a page from website A, followed by a page from website B and so on. If crawls are not parallelised, then the overhead on a single website is likely to be vastly increased.

### Robots Exclusion Protocol
Also known as the Robots.txt file. This is a standard used by websites to communicate with web crawlers and other web robots. Essentially it provides website owners a method to restrict part of their websites from scraping or limit scraping entirely to just certified scrapers such as search engines. More information on this subject can be found on the robots.txt website (Opens in a new window).

### User Agent String
A User Agent String is a custom piece of text that can be added to a a crawler or scraper allowing the website owner to identify the operator and/or the purpose of the web crwling or scraping activity being undertaken. With DiffWatch® progarmmes this can be modified for transparency.

### Web Crawler
A web crawler, sometimes referred to as a spider, is an internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web for the purposes of information gathering. The most common example of this is search engines like Google who use web crawlers to keep their search results up-to-date.

### Web Scraping
Web scraping is defined as the automatic collection of data retrieved from the internet using a piece of software or program.

# Annex 1. Guidance for website owners

## What options do website owners have when they receive an initial request letter from Advanced Analytica?

Advanced Analytica's Data Operations team will contact all website owners by email at least 3 weeks before web scraping commences, outlining the purpose and details of web scraping. Website owners would also be given an option of sharing required data directly with Advanced Analytica by having a data sharing agreement. 

Upon receipt of such email, website owners can request further information by writing back to the sender email address (Data.Ops@advancedanalytica.co.uk) and/or express your preference. 

Website owners have 2 weeks to refuse the request and if they wish to do so, website owners should reply to the sender email address by listing the reasons of why they refuse. If no reply is received 2 weeks after the email is sent, it would be taken as an approval and web scraping will start on the commencement date stated in the original email.

## Would website owners be informed about the progress?
If web scraping lasts longer than 3 months, and Advanced Analytica's Data Operations team will conduct a periodic review of the activity and this review can be shared with website owners if requested. If website owners would like to receive a regular update on the progress and/or have any request, please write to Data.Ops@advancedanalytica.co.uk.

## What happens if a website owner wishes to opt out?
If website owners wish to opt out, they can do so by replying to the initial request email sent by Data.Ops@advancedanalytica.co.uk within 2 weeks of receiving the initial request. In writing, they should state why they wish to opt out and Advanced Analytica's Data Operations team will engage with them promptly to address any concerns and to negotiate the next step, including other means of sharing the data. 

If website owners wish to opt out once web scraping commences, they can do so by writing to Data.Ops@advancedanalytica.co.uk and the Advanced Analytica's Data Operations team will engage with them promptly to solve any issues and/or to organise termination of the web scraping activities.
