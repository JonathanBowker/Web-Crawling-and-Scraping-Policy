# Web Scraping Policy
Advanced Analytica's policy for web scraping

## Background
Use of alternative data sources is vital for Advanced Analytica to achieve its objective of monitoring regulations (including risks caused by the way in which clients interest in relation to regulations. Web Scraping is one of these alternative data sources often used to supplement existing data sources. Therefore, the purpose of this policy is to ensure Web Scraping activities are conducted transparently, ethically and with respect to all relevant legislation.

This policy sets out the practices and procedures that Advanced Analytica will follow when carrying out web scraping. Web scraping is defined as the automatic collection of data retrieved from the internet, typically from HTML, using a piece of software or program.

## Scope
This policy sets out the practices and procedures that Advanced Analytica employees, temporary and casual staff, and any contractor, researcher or academic partner carrying out work for the agency or acting on our behalf must follow when carrying out web scraping.

When assessing external organisations who may scrape on behalf of Advanced Analytica, either via business as usual activities or on an ad-hoc basis, this policy will be used to guide assurance activities. This is to ensure appropriate governance structures are in place when gathering and processing data gathered via scraping activities.

**Note that this document does not cover the use of Application Programming Interfaces (API’s) and applies only to Advanced Analytica.**

## Next Review
We aim to keep all guidance up to date and undertake regular reviews to ensure this guidance remains relevant. The next scheduled review date for this guidance is 01/06/2023

## Compliance
All Advanced Analytica staff must comply with this policy in any project involving scraping data from the web. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action in line with Advanced Analytica’s discipline policy.

## Policy Statement
Advanced Analytica is carrying out web-scraping activity for the purposes of its business objectives functions in particular for selling insights derived from the analysis of data collected from alternative data sources.

Advanced Analytica will adopt the following principles to guide our web scraping activities:

- Seek to minimise the burden on scraped sites
- Abide by all applicable legislation and monitor the evolving legal and ethical situation
- Protect all personal data


## Policy Details

### Seek to minimise the burden on scraped sites
Excessive use of web scraping can be burdensome, and overuse on a single webpage may have a detrimental impact to the operation of the website. To avoid such scenarios, we will follow these practices, maintain a register of web scraping activity, where applicable, and always act within the limits of our statutory functions:

- Assess other data collection methods, such as RSS/Atom feeds or API’s, before considering the use of web scraping
- Respect scraping limitations enforced via documents like the Robots Exclusion Protocol (Robots.txt) and Site Terms and Conditions
- Delay accessing pages on the same domain
- Adding idle time between requests
- Limiting the depth of crawl within the given domain
- When scraping multiple domains, parallelising the crawling operation to minimise successive requests to the same domain
- Scraping at a time of day when the website is unlikely to be experiencing heavy traffic - for example, early in the morning or late in the night
- Optimising the web scraping strategy to minimise volumes of requests to domains
- Only collect the parts of pages required for the initial purpose
- Include a User Agent String to differentiate Advanced Analytica from other users

Please note that this list of best practices is non-exhaustive and Advanced Analytica will strive to maintain a high-standard of web-scraping by monitoring and implementing best practices.

## Abide by applicable legislation and monitor the evolving legal and ethical situation

Advanced Analytica understands that the legal situation surrounding web scraping is complex and ever evolving; and there are relatively few relevant legal precedents for conducting such activities. Advanced Analytica will continue to monitor the legal situation as it evolves and amend our approach accordingly. Likewise, Advanced Analytica recognises the use of web scraping and the processing of data collected in this manner may give rise to a variety of ethical issues and challenges. Efforts are currently underway to develop a practical framework for considering and mitigating potential ethical risks both directly and indirectly attributed to web scraping.

Those who wish to undertake web scraping activities must document and justify the rationale, the legal and ethical reasoning and the benefits of conducting the web scraping. This rationale will be used as the basis for approval from the Information Governance Board and will be scrutinised during the assessment phase to ensure continued alignment with applicable legislation. See section 9 for more details on this.

## Protect all personal data
Advanced Analytica is fully commited to compliance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (Opens in a new window) and ensuring that personal data is used lawfully, fairly and transparently. Data protection is of great importance to the Advanced Analytica, not only because it is critical to the work of our business, but also because it ensures we protect individual privacy and maintain public confidence in the company.
